# Java_Password_Generator
This project is about generating random strong passwords which should consist of uppercase, lowercase, special character, and a number. 
I have used random class to use random method.
Asked the user to enter the password length.
Created the strings of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters and concatenated to another string.
Created an array of the given length.
As the strong password should consist of one lowercase, uppercase, special character and a number so, I first concatenated the four random characters into the array.
Now according to the length given by the user, The remaining characters are concatenated to the array by using random method.
The final password is printed and displayed to the user.
